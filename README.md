Developed by Elisheva Ashlag, as part of Web-api Course;

üè™ Web API ‚Äì Store Project

Overview:
This project is a Web API that simulates an online store system.
At the current stage, the system includes:
*Login and Registration page
*User profile update page

Data Storage:
For now, user data is temporarily stored in a local TXT file, since database integration has not yet been covered in the course.
The TXT file contains sensitive user information and therefore is not uploaded to GitHub.
It is listed in the .gitignore file for security reasons.

Technologies Used:
*ASP.NET Core Web API
*C#
*HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for basic front-end functionality)

Future Development:
*Connect to a real database 
*Add product and shopping cart management
*Implement advanced authentication using JWT tokens
*Extend the front-end into a complete store interface
